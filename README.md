#Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The airgead banking app is a project that was built to show people the power of investing. it takes information from the user such as an initial investment, monthly deposit amount, and timeframe of that investment. After getting that information the program then shows the user how much money they will make with and without monthly recurring deposits. Ultimately it teaches the user the benifits of investing and the potential yearly profit totals.

#What did you do particularly well?
I believe I did well creating a clear and easy to use menu interface for the user to see the profit potentials on their chosen investments and timeframes.

#Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I should have created a loop for the user to enter differing investments and timeframes until they quit the program versus only allowing them to test one series of inputs.

#Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
For me the user input verification was the hardest by trying to come up with any possible scenarios that the user may incorrectly type input and crash the program. I used google with the Grepper extension to work through any issues with syntax and other problems that arose periodically with the program. This happened most frequently whenever I added more functionality to the program.

#What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Creating a user menu and verifying the users input I believe will be essential in many projects that I will create. What I learned during this project will help build on how I use menu interfaces and then test/use that input in the program to produce a correct result without unexpected circumstances arising.

#How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Primarily I made this program with the use of header files that broke the functionality of the program down into core concomponents. It kept main shorter with easier readability to understand the functionality of the program. Using test situations the programmer can narrow an issue down to a function and know what header file that portion of the code resides in versus having to look through every line od code in the program. Using header files also allows for more files to be adapted into the program as well as these files to be reused if need be.
